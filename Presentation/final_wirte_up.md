# Classification Project Write-up
## Will The Booking For Hotel Reservation Be Canceled?

### Abstract
In this analysis, multipe classification models are used to make prediction of hotel booking cancelation.

### Design
The project is designed to help hotels to predict if a booking will be canceled, find potential related features with booking cancelation, thus may adopt appropriate measures to decrease cancelation rate, thus to increase profit.

### Data
 The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand), which is comporised of over 119k observations and 36 features.  The data is a mixture of quantitative and categorical features and the target is a binary value of 0 and 1, with 0 means no cancelation and 1 represents the booking is canceled. Some features highlights include ```lead_time```(Number of days that elapsed between the entering date of the booking into the PMS and the arrival date), ```total_of_special_requests```(Number of special requests made by the customer),```assigned_room_type```,```adults```,```children```,```babies``` and etc. 

The dataset is obtained from contains 59,400 waterpoints with 40 features for each, 32 of which are categorical. A few feature highlights include measurements of water quantity and quality, pump types, and latitude/longitude coordinates. Nearly a third of the individual features could be grouped into more general categories, and an in-depth analysis of 20 of them was undertaken to inform baseline models and feature engineering.
